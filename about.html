<h3>About Me</h3>

<p style="max-width:700px; margin:auto; color:#9ca3af;">
Hi! I’m Toby Gregg, a young student who’s passionate about maximising my future potential and continuously improving my skills. I’m quick to learn and possess strong leadership and teamwork abilities.

I have a wide range of interests across various topics. Firstly, I’m an avid musician who currently plays electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, and a bit of keyboard. I never miss an opportunity to play in a group and always strive to learn new things.

I also enjoy filmmaking and videography. During my time at the Guernsey Sixth Form Centre, I’ve been studying the IB Film Diploma, immersing myself in the world of film. I’ve been using my own film equipment to create videos since a young age, starting with Lego stop-motion and progressing to professional promo videos for organisations.

Engineering has also been a significant interest of mine. Using my 3D printer, I’ve been designing and creating my ideas, utilising CAD software to enhance my knowledge of design and materials. Additionally, I’m passionate about computer science, particularly computer building and coding. I’ve built numerous PCs, and my study in computer science A-Level is progressing well.

Electronics is another area where I’m enthusiastic, creating various projects with my Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and ESP32s.

During my studies, I’ve completed my GCSEs with high grades in maths, combined science, English, Spanish, geography, computer science, music, and further maths. At the Guernsey Sixth Form Centre, I’m currently studying A-Levels in computer science, maths, physics, and IB film studies.

As a senior prefect, I’m taking advantage of my school opportunities to further develop my potential.
