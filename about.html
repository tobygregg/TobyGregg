        Studying the <strong>IB Film Diploma</strong> at Guernsey Sixth Form Centre,
        I’ve developed a deep understanding of storytelling and production.
        All my life I have had an interest in videography, starting with humble Lego stop-motions,
        but now I have progressed to <strong>professional videos </strong>for organisations and personal projects.
